        <p>We had to create a website to maintain the database of football players from all over the country that would allow them to get themselves registered based on their skill level.</p>
        <P>Players no longer depend on the evaluation platforms offered by their high school. This website has it all - from player biographies with statistics and awards received, so coaches can make an informed decision while selecting the player.</p>

              <p>It was clear from the beginning that this project wasn’t going to be easy because it involved so much data that had to be made secure.
                We sat down with our creative developers and designers and, after three brainstorming sessions, came up with the strategy and workflow that would be implemented to create this website.
                A few weeks of hard work later, we settled onto a website that had everything-from security to interactive UI.

        <p>The client’s willingness to accept our suggestions made this project a great treat for us, collaborating with someone who could actually understand the complexity of the project was an absolute delight.

        <p>Creating a database that would be operational on a national level was a challenge for our team, but challenges are what keeps us going.
          We developed the whole website but ensured that the client was on board with the designs from time to time to further move into development swiftl.</p>
