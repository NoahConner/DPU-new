               Paul Cookson said, "Websites promote you 24/7: No employee will do that." Having a website is essential for any business in today's time. But do all websites generate equal sales?
                <br />
                <br />
              The answer is No.
                <br /> <br />The design and layout of a website play a significant role in attracting and engaging your customer. A visitor who clicks on your website but does not find an easy-to-navigate design would hardly stay. It is not possible to get sales until your website design is compatible with the user's comfort. In today's world of business, achieving optimal and automated processes that share sensitive data and interact is crucial. However, an additional requirement has arisen that will make or break your company; API integration.
                <br>
                <br>
                Web designer Joel Spolsky explained it as, "Design adds value faster than it adds costs." A captivating website design is believed to play a fundamental role in skyrocketing sales.

                <p>
               You might not have considered it, but customers take the first impression from your website and judge you based on your website design. If your website does not respond properly, or has an outdated website design, visitors would not readily trust you.
                <br />
                <br />
                Studies show that 38% of the visitors do not navigate pages on a site they find unattractive.
                <br /> 
                <br />
                To save yourself from such situations, it is better to redesign your website more sophisticatedly to engage potential customers.

                 <h2>Typography</h2>
                 What is the first thing that catches your attention when you visit a website? Yes, the text and the images. If you have a text that does not seem appealing on the first look, your website would seem old-fashioned. And people do not usually prefer buying from a website that is not up-to-date.
                <br />
                <br />
                 To make sure that your potential customers become your actual customers, taking care of your website's typography is of sheer importance.

                It is common for videos to attract us immediately because our brain responds to moving things more than static ones. To utilize this factor, you can add a few videos on your website about your products, tutorials, or even celebrities and customers' reviews. Experts say that adding appropriate videos to your website can increase sales up to 140 percent and help you gain a loyal customer base.
                <br />
                <br />
                <h2>Highlighted CTAs</h2>
                CTAs are a part of most of the websites nowadays. So if you don't have one, consider adding attractive CTAs to your website.
                <br /> 
                <br /> 
                    If you already have some CTAs on your site and still don't get enough clicks, you might consider making a few changes.      
                <ul>
                    <li>Change the color of the Call To Action to some bright color that draws the customer's attention.</li>
                    <li>If you have short CTAs like "Click Here," etc., add some description to make it more compelling.</li>
                </ul>
                <br />

                <p>
                 According to Ellen Lupton, "Design is as much an act of spacing as an act of marking." And all designers and marketers agree to it.  While designing a website, do not forget that putting numerous banners or images on your website does not ensure better sales.
                <br>
                The white space is a part of the website design and allows visitors to focus on your CTAs and product images. Don't miss on adding images or videos that can benefit your business, meanwhile avoid cluttering the space.

                People have opted for online shopping more frequently because it is a lot less time-consuming. Suppose the customer has to spend a couple of minutes to find the categories and products on your website. In that case, they might move to another website with better features. A simple rule of maintaining a website that generates revenue is to offer convenience to your customer.
                <br>
                <br>
                Easy navigation means to present everything about your website to the visitor on a plate. They should have to do nothing but only click on their desired function.
                <br />
                <br />
                <h2>Excerpt:</h2>
Paul Cookson said, "Websites promote you 24/7: No employee will do that." Having a website is essential for any business in today's time. However, all websites do not generate equal sales regardless if they belong to the same niche or a different one. Sites that stand out are those with easy navigation and website designs that attract customers. Maintaining a winning website is a lot more than just adding products and their descriptions. Working on the typography, CTAs, and making the right use of the white space are among the factors that collectively make a website that sells.
